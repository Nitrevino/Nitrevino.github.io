    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<div>
<p>Industrialized Hawaiian sugar production illustrates how market globalization, technology, and consumption can rapidly alter the local environments and cultures.  In 1875, pressure from the US government led to the treaty of reciprocity between the US and Hawaii, which immediately increased US’s involvement in Hawaiian governance and agriculture. Within a decade, US investment in the Hawaiian sugar industry altered Hawaii’s local subsistence economy into a global industrial export economy exporting sugar to North America.  Increased sugar production replaced island soils, forests, and waters with cash crops. Sugar cane’s industrialized plantation culture exploited both tropical ecology and people by setting up a centralized and hierarchal control over the island.</p>
<p>Hawaii’s Industrialized sugar production infrastructure has eroded nutrient rich soils, consumed local water flows, and threatened local forests. To feed the large-scale industrial mechanism, sugar planters cut down biodiversity rich communal forests that indigenous communities used for food and shelter. They replaced communal grounds with privately owned sugar cane and beet monocultures. A small cabal of sugar industrialists planted monocultures that caused new problems like crop disease, pests, and soil depletion. To sustain this monoculture, Sugar industrialists introduced foreign species and chemicals that threatened Hawaii’s unique and sensitive island ecosystem. Sugarcane, which requires rich soil, quickly depleted nutrients and grew reliant on commercial fertilizers. To sustain crop growth, sugar industrialists created irrigation networks that redirected water away from old growth forests and indigenous communities and towards sugar cane plantations.</p>

<p>Hawaii’s sugar economy is inherently tied to the system that systematically deprived indigenous Hawaiians of their property, voting rights, and life. From 1800-1900 over 600,000 Hawaiians died of died of diseases like measles, chicken pox, polio and tuberculosis from settlers. Sugar industrialists pushed for land privatization and distribution policies, which untangled horizontal bonds within communities and vertical bonds between people and their monarchs. When land became privatized, Sugar industrialists took advantage and bought massive parcels of profitable land, which increased their political power and pushed natives off their land. As the industry became more mechanized, native local sugar farmers couldn’t compete and became swallowed up by sugar industrialist. Landless natives grew dependent on work from sugar industrialist’s sugar cane production. Sugar industrialist pushed for the Bayonet constitution, which restricted the vote to landholders or the rich, which excluded 2/3 Hawaiians. This culminated in the illegal deposition of Queen Lili‘uokalani by planting interests.</p>

<p>Within the last 30 years, rising labour costs, new technology, and a focus on tourism has caused most Hawaiian sugar mills to close. Sugar plantations lost land and political power to the growing tourism industry and the military. This caused many factory workers to lose relatively high paying unionized jobs and become folded into the tourism industry. Today, much of the water that once went to sugar plantations now goes to housing complexes.</p>
