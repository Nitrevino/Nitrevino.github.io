<h1> Sugar and your health </h1>

<p>There is a firm scientific consensus that sugar overconsumption has significant links to heart disease, diabetes, tooth decay, obesity, and other non-communicable cardiovascular and kidney diseases.</p>

<p>Lustig justifies government action against sugar by comparing it to the reasons public health activists give for regulating Alcohol. Like alcohol, sugar is unavoidable, toxic, has a abuse potential, and has a negative impact on society. He claims that sugar manufactures have laced nearly all processed foods with sugar making it incredibly challenging for consumers to avoid.  This makes sugar commonly abused, because sugar changes brain chemistry to increase intake and create dependence forming behaviors. Sugar’s linkage to non-communicable diseases damages proteins, DNA and liver glucose production.  This ultimately costs society 65 Billion in lost productivity and 150 Billion on health care resources (nature)</p>

<p>The UN reports that these chronic non-communicable diseases pose a greater health risk than infectious diseases. Western diets, characterized by low cost processed food stuffed with preservatives, spread has left 30% more people obese than undernourished. (nature)</p>


<h2> <b> Heart  and cardiovascular disease </b> </h2>

<p>An American Medical Association study found that people who receive “US adults consume more added sugar than is recommended for a healthy diet. 25 percent or more of their calories from sugar are twice as likely to die from heart disease as those who take in less than 10 percent.“</p>

<p>Vos MB et al. from the American Heart Association conducted a literature review to conclude that “Associations between added sugars and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among US children are present at levels far below current consumption levels. Strong evidence supports the association of added sugars with increased cardiovascular disease risk in children through increased energy intake, increased adiposity, and dyslipidemia.“</p>

<p>Yang Q from the “division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention used time trend analysis to conclude that “Most US adults consume more added sugar than is recommended for a healthy diet. We observed a significant relationship between added sugar consumption and increased risk for CVD mortality.</p>

<h2> <b>  Diabetes </b> </h2>

<p>The Obama Administration’s 2015 Agriculture Department Dietary Guidelines recommend Americans keep sugar calories to just 10% of their diet due the risk of unhealthy weight gain and type two diabetes.</p>

<p>Sanjay Basu from Stanford conducted a cross-cultural study using nutrition information and health outcomes to find that “every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1% (p <0.001)” </p>

<p> Richard Johnson from the University of Florida’s Division of Nephrology found that excessive fructose intake (>50 g/d) may in part cause metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19151107">click here to learn more about their study.</a>


<p>Bray GA from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center conducted a meta analysis to conclude that “By worsening blood lipids, contributing to obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, and gout, fructose in the amounts currently consumed is hazardous to the health of some people.”</p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23493538">click here to learn more about their study.</a>





<p>de Koning L from Harvard School of Public Health studied 40,389 men to conclude that “Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with a significantly elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas the association between artificially sweetened beverages and type 2 diabetes was largely explained by health status, pre-enrollment weight change, dieting, and body mass index.“</p>

<p>Imamura F et al from University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine’s Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit used a meta-analysis research design to conclude that “Habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was associated with a greater incidence of type 2 diabetes“</p>

<h2> <b> Obesity</b> </h2>



<p>Keller A from the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland conducted a metaanalysis of the sugary beverage literature to conclude that “The majority of reviews concluded that there was a direct association between Sugary beverages consumption and weight gain, overweight, and obesity in children and adolescents.“</p>

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258560">click here to learn more about their study.</a>



<p>Bucher Della Torre S, from the school of Public health in Geneva conducted a metaanalysis of the literature to conclude, “the majority of studies with strong methodology indicated a positive association between Sugary beverage consumption and risk of obesity or obesity, especially among overweight children."</p>

<p>Vasanti S Malik from the Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health conducted a meta-analysis of the Sugar sweetened beverage literature and concluded “The weight of epidemiologic and experimental evidence indicates that a greater consumption of SSBs is associated with weight gain and obesity."</p>


<h2> <b> Other</b> </h2>
<p>Ouyang X from the University of Florida’s Division of Nephrology found that the “Consumption of fructose in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was nearly 2- to 3-fold higher than controls“</p>

<p>Carwile JL from Harvard School of Public Health’s department of Epidemiology studied 5,583 girls ages  9-14 to conclude that “More frequent sugary beverage consumption may predict earlier menarche through mechanisms other than increased BMI. Our findings provide further support for public health efforts to reduce SSB consumption.”</p>

<p>Chiu YH from Harvard School of Public Health’s Department of Nutrition studied 189 men ages 18-22 and concluded that “sugary beverage intake was inversely related to progressive sperm motility. “</p>
