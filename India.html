    <h1> India: The story of Fertilizers, Debt and Water</h1>
<div>


<p>Mechanized farming and the Green Revolution increased India’s sugar production making it the 2nd largest sugar supplier in the world. India’s increasing sugar production uses 5 million hectares of land and employs 60 million cane farmers and their dependents. Sugar consumption in Punjab is expected to rise by 56% in the coming years stressing already stressed water resources.</p>

<p>South Indian sugar farmers using green revolution chemical fertilizers and pesticides have racked up debt and committed suicide. In 2015 in Karnataka, 90 sugar cane workers committed suicide from getting trapped in a cyclical debt cycle in which they must repeatedly take out debt to buy expensive fertilizers and pesticides to farm. Long-term financial insecurity pushes people towards suicide, especially in times of drought, which climate change has made more likely. The average debt of farmers who committed suicide is 7,701 USD, 27 times higher than Karnataka’s average debt. </p>

<p>Neoliberal policies have reduced the safety nets that small-scale farmers relied on like subsidies and price regulations. When India tried to raise subsidies, the WTO objected, because they feared it would stifle international competition in Brazil, Thailand, and Australia.</p>

<p>Chemical fertilizer’s price is rising faster than food making them less efficient over time. To stay competitive in the short run, farmers buy nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers that reduce long term soil fertility by degrade soil’s hummus content and biodiversity. In the long run, fertilizers worsen climate change by increase nitrous oxide, a green house gas. </p>
<p>Sugar cane grown under water intensive Green Revolution farming methods has a startlingly high environmental impact. Sugar cane uses about 1500-2000mm/ha/year of water making it much more water-intensive than other crops. Concentrated irrigated sugar cane plantations contribute to water scarcity and deplete local ground water supplies. Within Maharashtra, sugar cane covers only about 3% of land, and yet it consumes about 60% of the state’s irrigated water supplies causing a water table trop since becoming a key cash crop.</p>

<p>Sugar plantations primarily exist in rural areas far away from regulatory oversight allowing them to release industrial wastewater into rural community’s water supply with chronically less political representation and lower income. While the drinking water specification of 1991 prohibit dumping sugar mill effluent in drinking water quality, these laws are poorly enforced.</p>

<p>Sangamner Nagarpalika et al studied the Sangammer sugar factory in rural Maharashtra, and found that sugar mill effluent containing toxic heavy metals and harmful chemicals like Cl-, SO 2-, PO 3-, Mg+2 and NO -3  routinely entered the surrounding areas water supply increasing microorganisms, placing the community at risk for developmental diseases, and contaminating crops sold in other Indian regions. Many of the contaminants show chronic rather than long-term effects, which makes it hard for communities to realize the effects of pollution.</p>
<p>Increasing fertilizer use in Indian farms has mirrored an increasing cancer rate in India’s rural regions. Scientists from Exeter University found that 20% of drinking wells sampled in Punjab have nitrate above safe levels, but people have no choice other than drink the water. Drinking nitrate-contaminated water has been linked to digestive tract cancer, bladder and ovarian cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. </p>
