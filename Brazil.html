    <h1>Brazil: Sugar Cane Deforestation and Landlessness</h1>
<div>
<p>Industrialization and mechanization has ballooned Brazillian sugar production to record levels, and exacerbated mass deforestation and biodiversity loss. From 2003 to 2008, Brazil’s sugar cane production increased from 390 million tons to 690 million tons (ILO,2009). In 2009, Brazil exported around about 47% of world’s processed raw sugar by volume (ILO, 2009). </p>

<p>Wealth from sugar production varies greatly based on the region. Three hundred sugar plants production plantations have set up in south-central Brazil’s richer soils, especially in Sao Paulo, which accounts for 75-80% of sugar cane production (Krivonos, 2009). Domestic and international sugar sales have brought in 9.8 Billion USD, but these profits have gone to agro businesses owners rather than the workers (Krivonos, 2009).</p>
<p>Sugar plantations have exacerbated deforestation and serious biodiversity loss in environmentally sensitive regions and damaged ecosystem services. In Alagoas Brazil, sugar production has reduced already threatened rainforests so now only 3% remain (Krivonos, 2009). This has dismantled animal’s habitats causing species extinction and unchangeably altering ecosystems. The loss of critical ecosystem services threatens communities by depriving them of resources they’ve built communities around. Deforestation has altered the region’s hydrologic cycle reducing small villages access to clean water (Krivonos, 2009).</p>

<p>Sugar plantation workers’ few resources and little formalized education leave them vulnerable to the sugar industry’s changing economic conditions. While Sugar farmer’s literacy rate changes based on the state, around 55% of the work force is either illiterate or poorly educated, and 60% have not completed primary school (Costa,2007). This provides them few options little social mobility and makes them dependent on plantation work or other manual labour. </p>
<p>Plantation owners take advantage of undocumented immigrants, especially children, within the sugar industry with low wages and dangerous working conditions. A US department of Labour Report found that 90% of children and 40% of adult workers lacked documentation, and had few labour protections and protective clothing (Costa,2007). Labour inspection teams from the ILO often meet heavily armed guards and rural workers untrusting to raise potential labour complaints (Costa,2007). At one mill, investigators found that 40% of children worked 40 hours per week or more. Despite dangerous working conditions that can cause injuries like machete wounds, entanglement in machines injury, and heat exposure, sugar cane harvesting pays their seasonal workers paid low hourly wages, if they’re paid(Costa,2007).</p>
<p>In 2007, 2947 people were rescued from four Sugar production mills (Costa,2007).</p>

<p>Multinational sugar corporations have exploited the legal system to take indigenous peoples's land. Indigenous communities often lack official documentation to their land, so multinational sugar corporations have bought their land, without their consent, and pushed them towards suicide (Oxfam, 2013). Indigenous communities’ land provides water, livelihood, identity, and yet indigenous people have lost their ancestral lands they held for centuries (Oxfam, 2013). In Guarani-Kaiowa between 2000-2012, sugar cane plantations expanded six times, and in 2013, it also experienced the world’s highest suicide rate at 72 suicides mostly among the Jatayvara indigenous community (Watts,2013).</p>
<p>Bunge, a US based Sugar Company responsible for exploiting indigenous communities sells sugar to Coke (Oxfam,2016). Despite this, Coke commonly uses indigenous peoples' images in their advertisements (Oxfam, 2016).</p>

<p>OXFAM claims that Usina Traphiche, a sugar company that sells to Pepsi, has tried to displace a small fishing community in Sirinhaém so they can expand their operations. The community claims that private militias owned by Usina Traphiche have attacked their houses and destroyed their land. This state has the highest level of land conflict in Brazil with 42/105 cases of violence were related to sugar cane.</p>
