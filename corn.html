    <h1>Corn: An American monoculture </h1>


<p>The rise of American fructose presents different environmental and social problems than sugarcane industries in other parts of the globe. </p>
<p>Corn’s adaptability and use in a wide variety of products encourage farmers from Pennsylvania to Nebraska to grow it. Much of this corn doesn’t become High Fructose Corn Syrup (Corn sugar), because fuel subsidies push most production towards ethanol. </p>
<p>Farmers often choose to grow corn monocultures, because in the short run they’re efficient and profitable using factory farming techniques (Foley, 2013). Around 12% of our total million farmed acres go to corn alone totaling over 90 million acres of land (USDA, 2017).</p>
<p>Many American companies choose to buy Corn sugar rather than sugar cane/beet sugar, because corn sugar’s comparative advantage reduces its price. </p>
<p>Corn requires a lot of freshwater (5.6 cubic miles per year of irrigated water) and fertilizer (5.6 million tones of nitrogen) every year (Foley,2013). </p>
<p>Monocultures are especially vulnerable to disease or market changes destroying the entire crop, just as one pathogen destroyed the Irish potato harvest from 1845-1852. This would simultaneously increase both fuel and food prices (Foley,2013).</p>

<p>Monocultures ruin soil health by continuously draining the same nutrients from the soil hastening erosion. Farmers compensate for the weaker soil by increasing their fertilizer, pesticide, and water use (Hartman, 2008). </p>
<p>Michael Pollen, author of “In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto” attributes the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone to Corn Sugar production (Hartman, 2008). He claims fertilizer non-point source pollution has caused excess nitrogen loads to catalyze algae populations that decompose and suck all the oxygen out of bodies of water (NOAA, 2015).</p>
<p>The government has especially difficult time managing non-point source pollution like this, because they must create and enforce legislation involving millions of stakeholders across state lines. </p>
<p>Corn sugar’s low price encourages American food manufactures to shove sugar into their processed foods and still keep it at a low price. This disproportionally affects poorer Americans that eat cheap processed food, because they can’t afford healthy food. </p>
