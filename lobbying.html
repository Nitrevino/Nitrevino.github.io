<h1>Sugar, Science, and Lobbying </h1>

<p>To encourage sales, the sugar industry has tried to obscure the scientific consensus that sugar overconsumption can have serious health impacts. While consumers often hesitate to add more sugar into their food, they generally don’t realize how much sugar is already in their food, even in foods that aren’t that sweet.</p>


<p>As a result, from 1970-2000 Americans consumed 25% more sugar and now consume 3 times more sugar than the daily-recommended income.</p>


<p>The sugar and drink industry have spent millions lobbying against public health laws that would better inform Americans about their food’s sugar content and its affect on their body. Americans don’t understand their daily sugar consumption, because the sugar lobby and PR firms have used tactics honed by the tobacco industry to sow confusion, misinformation, and inauthentic uncertainty.</p>


<p>They’ve hired scientists sow confusion, spent money lobbying politicians, and made political contributions to politicians, and have tried to influence federal rule making. This has left federal and state legislatures paralyzed to address this public health crisis.</p>


<p>In 2003, the sugar association warned the WHO that they would lobby congressional appropriators to reduce their funding, because they released a scientific report advising people to limit their sugar intake and claiming that “added sugars” reduce diet’s nutation.</p>



<p>The Sugar lobby has distorted the science by spreading false claims and misinformation about sugar’s health affects to make a profit.</p>



<p>For example, On Nestlé’s website, they promote a “factsheet” advising parents not to limit their children’s sugar intake, and claiming that the evidence doesn’t support sugar consumption’s link to body weight gain (when it does).</p>


<p>So parents, don’t get your parenting advice from a sugar website.</p>


<p>Sugar trade associations, like The Sugar Association, use social media to attack the link between sugar consumption and diabetes. They’ve claimed that “sugar adds to the children’s diet” and that “every major review of the scientific literature exonerates sugar as the cause of any disease, including obesity.” A claim so laughably wrong it’s insulting.</p>


<p>Sugar lobbying groups have partnered with powerful PR groups to spread misinformation. For example, a public health group wanted to rename “High Fructose Corn Syrup” to corn sugar to better inform customers about their sugar consumption. The sugar association paid the ironically named Citizens For Health $350,000 to fight the effort.</p>

<p>The sugar industry has paid industry scientists to spread misinformation about the sugar’s health impact. Scientists have taken sugar money and spread misinformation without disclosing their link to the sugar industry.</p>


<p>For example in The Annals of Internal medicine, scientists published an article attacking the FDA’s sugar guidelines, but they never disclosed their ties to the sugar industry, which earned the ire of their peer public health scientists. From 2014, 156 of the 168 Nestle funded studies reviewed showed favorable results for Nestle.</p>


<p>Coke has specifically funded scientists to promote exercise, rather than diet solutions to obesity. At the same time, they’ve increased their sales of sugary exercise beverages. They’re trying to make money by creating the problem and selling the solution.</p>


<p>In 2009, lobbying by Coca-Cola, Pepsi co, and The American Beverage Association lobbied against a federal excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverage that would have balanced against their negative health externalities. This spiked sugar lobbying funds up to over 37 million dollars, an 8 times increase over 2008 levels.</p>


<p>Under the Trump administration, the sugar lobby has tried to reduce sugar subsidies that increase the price of candies. The National Confectionaries association have booked Trump hotel properties for meetings, which they claim is not a tactic to influence Trump, but I mean come on. These actions directly profit the president that they are trying to influence to change government policy. While they have not stated how much they paid Trump Organization, it is estimated by the Washington post that they range from 100 to 200 K.</p>
